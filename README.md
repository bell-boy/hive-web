# hive üêù
The goal of hive is to provide a platform to connect students looking for internships/research opportunities with employers and institutions, particularly high school students in the Houston Area.
It'll provide an easy way for students to apply and for employers to look at credentials.

### Problem Solved
Many students want internships at various companies for various reasons. Likewise, Houston companies are expanding and looking for cheaper ways to do tasks high school students are more than happy to do. However, students have a hard time finding these opportunities, and the few that are obtained are usually through word of mouth.

### Goals
* Students can create public profiles similar to LinkedIn where their basic info can be viewed.
* A job board where companies can post open listings for students to quickly apply to.
* Students and Companies/Institutions should be able to view this information on both mobile and web.

### Technical Breakdown
The backend of the App will use Firebase & Express for API requests, storage, and authentication.
The front end will be handled by a react app [here](https://github.com/bell-boy/hive-web).
